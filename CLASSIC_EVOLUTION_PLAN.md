‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Metal: 1-3 per planet per minute
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Energy: 0.5-1 per energy source per minute  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Crystals: 0-0.5 per rare source per minute

Mid Game (5-15 min): Moderate resources, building construction viable
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Metal: 5-15 per planet per minute (with buildings)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Energy: 3-8 per energy source per minute
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Crystals: 1-3 per rare source per minute

Late Game (15+ min): High resources, superweapon/megastructure costs balanced
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Metal: 20-50 per planet per minute (fully developed)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Energy: 15-30 per energy source per minute
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Crystals: 5-15 per rare source per minute
```

#### **Technology Research Times**
```
Tier 1 Technologies: 60-90 seconds
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Immediately useful
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Low resource cost
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Clear strategic benefit

Tier 2 Technologies: 120-180 seconds  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Require strategic planning
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Moderate resource investment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Significant power increase

Tier 3 Technologies: 240-300 seconds
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game-changing capabilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ High resource commitment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Victory condition enablers
```

### **Combat Balance Matrix**

#### **Ship Cost vs Effectiveness**
```
Basic Ships: Cost 1 Metal, HP 100, DPS 20, Speed 1.0
Heavy Ships: Cost 3 Metal, HP 250, DPS 30, Speed 0.8
Scout Ships: Cost 2 Metal, HP 60, DPS 15, Speed 1.5
Bomber Ships: Cost 4 Metal, HP 80, DPS 35 (vs shields), Speed 0.9
```

#### **Defensive Structure Balance**
```
Planetary Shield (Level 1): Cost 50 Metal + 20 Energy/min, 200 HP
Orbital Defense (Level 1): Cost 75 Metal + 15 Energy/min, 20 DPS
Combined Defense: Should require 3x attacking force to overcome efficiently
```
