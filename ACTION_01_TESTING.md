---

## ðŸ§ª Testing Battery

### **Test Group A: Core Resource Mechanics**

#### **A1: Resource Generation**
**Objective**: Verify metal generates correctly on all planets
```
Test Steps:
1. Start new game
2. Observe metal counter for 60 seconds
3. Check generation rates match planet capacities
4. Verify generation stops when storage full

Expected Results:
- Small planets: 1-2 metal/minute
- Medium planets: 2-3 metal/minute  
- Large planets: 3-4 metal/minute
- Generation pauses at capacity limit

Pass Criteria: âœ… All generation rates within 10% of target
```

#### **A2: Resource Consumption**
**Objective**: Ships cost resources and can't be built without sufficient metal
```
Test Steps:
1. Start with 10 metal
2. Build 10 basic ships (1 metal each)
3. Attempt to build 11th ship
4. Wait for metal generation
5. Build additional ship

Expected Results:
- Ships cost 1 metal each to build
- 11th ship fails to build (insufficient resources)
- Ship builds successfully after metal regenerates

Pass Criteria: âœ… Resource blocking works, ships consume correct amounts
```

#### **A3: Storage Capacity**
**Objective**: Planets have storage limits based on capacity
```
Test Steps:
1. Find large planet (capacity 25)
2. Wait for metal to reach 25
3. Verify generation stops
4. Build ships to reduce metal to 20
5. Verify generation resumes

Expected Results:
- Metal stops generating at planet capacity
- Generation resumes when below capacity
- UI shows storage limit clearly

Pass Criteria: âœ… Storage limits work correctly, clear visual feedback
```

### **Test Group B: UI and Visual Systems**

#### **B1: Resource Display**
**Objective**: Metal counter shows correct information
```
Test Steps:
1. Check metal display shows current amount
2. Verify counter updates in real-time
3. Check display during resource consumption
4. Test with multiple planets generating

Expected Results:
- Metal counter updates smoothly (every 1-2 seconds)
- Shows total empire metal, not per-planet
- Counter decreases immediately when building ships
- Display format is clear and readable

Pass Criteria: âœ… UI updates correctly, information is clear
```

#### **B2: Planet Resource Indicators**
**Objective**: Individual planets show resource info
```
Test Steps:
1. Hover over different planets
2. Check resource generation rates shown
3. Verify storage amounts displayed
4. Test with planets at different capacity levels

Expected Results:
- Tooltip shows "Metal: X/Y (+Z/min)"
- Generation rate matches planet size
- Storage shown as current/max
- Different planets show different values

Pass Criteria: âœ… Planet tooltips show accurate resource info
```

#### **B3: Visual Feedback**
**Objective**: Resource changes have visual indicators
```
Test Steps:
1. Watch for resource generation visual effects
2. Check for feedback when building ships
3. Verify storage full indicators
4. Test resource flow animations (if implemented)

Expected Results:
- Subtle visual pulse when resources generate
- Clear feedback when resources spent
- Visual indicator when storage full
- Smooth animations enhance UX

Pass Criteria: âœ… Visual feedback enhances gameplay without distraction
```

### **Test Group C: Strategic Gameplay**

#### **C1: Resource Scarcity Decisions**
**Objective**: Resource limits create strategic choices
```
Test Steps:
1. Start game and expand to 3 planets
2. Attempt to build large fleet quickly
3. Experience resource constraints
4. Make decisions about planet priorities
5. Test different expansion strategies

Expected Results:
- Can't build unlimited ships immediately
- Must choose between expansion and military
- Resource generation encourages longer-term planning
- Multiple viable strategies emerge

Pass Criteria: âœ… Resource constraints create meaningful decisions
```

#### **C2: Pace and Balance**
**Objective**: Resource system doesn't slow gameplay too much
```
Test Steps:
1. Play 5-minute classic-style game
2. Compare with original game speed
3. Check if players can still execute quick strategies
4. Verify resource generation doesn't bottleneck flow

Expected Results:
- Early game feels similar to original
- Resource constraints become factor after 2-3 minutes
- Quick raids and captures still possible
- Longer games have more strategic depth

Pass Criteria: âœ… Game pace preserved, depth added gradually
```

### **Test Group D: Integration and Performance**

#### **D1: System Integration**
**Objective**: Resource system works with existing game mechanics
```
Test Steps:
1. Test with planet conquest
2. Verify with fleet movement
3. Check AI interaction with resources
4. Test with different game modes

Expected Results:
- Conquered planets immediately contribute resources
- Fleet movement unaffected by resource system
- AI can't build unlimited ships either
- System works in all game modes

Pass Criteria: âœ… No conflicts with existing systems
```

#### **D2: Performance Impact**
**Objective**: Resource system doesn't affect game performance
```
Test Steps:
1. Monitor FPS with resource system active
2. Test with 20+ planets generating resources
3. Check memory usage increases
4. Verify no lag during resource updates

Expected Results:
- FPS remains at 60 with resource calculations
- Memory increase under 10MB
- No noticeable lag during resource updates
- System scales well with planet count

Pass Criteria: âœ… Performance impact minimal (<5% FPS loss)
```
